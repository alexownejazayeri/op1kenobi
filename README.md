# OP-1 Kenobi

## Credit
Shunya Koide for incredible CSS artistry -- thanks for your Codepen and enabling this project!

## Overview
This project makes use of [Shunya Koide's](https://codepen.io/shunyadezain) OP-1 [Codepen](https://codepen.io/shunyadezain/pen/QWyVwep) written in pure HTML and SCSS. With a long ways to go before achieving this level of CSS wizardry I aimed to bring this to life in React by pushing the HTML elements out to components.

## Skills I Practiced
[ ] Separation of concerns
[ ] Decluttering components and imports
[ ] Using hooks like useEffect() to listen to keyboard events
[ ] Traversing an array of objects to dynamically pull data into a component with functional methods e.g.(.filter(), .map())

## Next steps
[] Pull SVG elements from the Teenage Engineering OP-1 tutorial and replace SCSS with interactive, animated SVG components.
[] Create more options for sound libraries
